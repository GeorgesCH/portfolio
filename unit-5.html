		<h2>Formative Activities</h2>
      <p>Identify a system and a piece of software of your choice, i.e. operating system or an application that you are familiar with. Investigate the features of these pieces of software and then compare their features. Where appropriate, use images to demonstrate and explain the functionality of these pieces of software. </p>
      <div class="box">
        <p><strong>Investigating Healthcare by Apple</strong><br>Apple is developing a platform to help users to keep track of their health, through the Watch and the health app. They’ve recently released a new feature allowing to measures a wearer’s blood oxygen levels and heart rhythms. It seems that Apple is moving toward healthcare, as they’ve increased their healthcare presence by expanding the product capabilities and partnering with leading health centres and research institutions.
          One of the key successes to Apple, is the access they have to users, and their data that are currently being collecting using various methods, also Apple has gained the trust of the users to share, and store regularly personal and health data. 
          The health app uses automatic syncing of various data inputs to allow users to keep track of their sleep patterns, daily activities and much more. </p>

      <h2><strong>Reflections</strong></h2>
      <p>This unit has allowed me to learn about the different types of software and digital solutions, as well as it was very helpful to learn flode to build the flow of data processing, I have developed programs before but never tend to actually visualise the process, now I feel more confident to come up with new algorithms and to be able to visualise it for testing, optimisation, and most importantly to be able to share my ideas and process with others. </p>
