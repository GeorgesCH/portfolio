	<p><strong>Introduction to HTML</strong></p>
<p>The HTML excerises were a good exercise to see how the HTML and HTML5 have evaluated since the first time I learned HTML.</p>
<p><strong>Emerging Technology</strong></p>
<p>Virtual Machine: an instance of a physical computer with the only difference that virtual machines are computing within physical servers, existing only as code. Using virtual machines can be useful to set up a dedicated environment for a program, or a server. Also, during the research and development phase, where it allows us to create an unlimited number of computers with different operating systems using code only and sharing the resources of the same physical computer/server.</p>
<p><strong>Bring Your Own Device (BYOD): </strong>This is a policy that&rsquo;s set by companies to allow employees to use their personal devices such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets for work. Which can help business reduce the fixed costs and maintenance for such while it can have some downside with security risks and privacy, as the device isn&rsquo;t managed by the company the employee is free to download and use other software and programs that might have access to certain corporate data. Also, other users might be allowed to use their personal computers and might have access to the company files and data.</p>
<p><strong>Parallel computing: </strong>Parallel computing refers to the process of breaking down larger problems into smaller, independent, often similar parts that can be executed simultaneously by multiple processors communicating via shared memory, the results of which are combined upon completion as part of an overall algorithm. The primary goal of parallel computing is to increase available computation power for faster application processing and problem-solving.</p>
<p><strong>Hadoop: </strong>a collection of tools that allows the storing of big data in a readily accessible and distributed environment. It enables processing the data parallelly, it&rsquo;s also an open-source framework that is quite popular in the big data industry.</p>
<p><strong>Distributed computing: </strong>a field of computer science that studies distributed systems, that systems with components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another to achieve a common goal.</p>
<h2><strong>Reflections</strong></h2>
<p>In this unit, I learned about networking and computer networks which how network infrastructure comprises hardware and software to enables computing and communication between users, services, application and processes using different communication networks security protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol TCP/IP, HTTP, Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the secure version of HTTP, FTP, Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocols. These protocols require management protocols to maintain and govern the network through protocols such as ICMP and SNMP.</p>
