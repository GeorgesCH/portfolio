      </ul>
      <h3>Discussions/Formative activities:</h3>
      <h4>My initial post</h4>
      <p>When the EU introduced the&nbsp;GDPR regulation, I got many requests from various clients to comply with the new policies and update the terms of use of their websites. I was by then living outside the EU and didn't actually understand how crucial it is to comply with these standards.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Understanding standardization and regulation is something on my top list to take out of this program. I also belive that many business around the glob reserve a big database of user data and it will be interesting to know how forgien websites and business implement these regulations for visitors from the EU. According to the&nbsp;GDPR compliance guide, the&nbsp;GDPR does apply outside Europe if the organisation uses web tools to track cookies or the IP addresses of people that visit the website from EU countries.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        After Brexit, the UK organisations that process personal data must now comply with the below according to&nbsp;itgovernance.co.uk</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The DPA (Data Protection Act) 2018 and UK GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) if they process only domestic personal data.</li>
        <li>The DPA 2018 and UK GDPR, and the EU GDPR if they process domestic personal data and offers goods and services to, or monitor the behaviour of, EU residents.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Reflections</h2>
      <p>I enjoyed working on the first week of the course, it has allowed me to understand the different roles of a computer practitioner and how it&rsquo;s employed in the current changing market, I have also learned the legal regulations and ethics for collecting and storing personal data such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the BCS Code of Conduct.</p>
      <p><strong>e-Portfolio set up</strong></p>
      <p>I have worked with GIT and other version control system before, as well as I&rsquo;m well experienced in HTML5, CSS, and Javascript, which made setting up the portfolio easy. However, I kind of missed a couple of the GIT commands as it&rsquo;s been a while I didn&rsquo;t use them, so it was nice to remember those.</p>
      <p>Also, I didn&rsquo;t know that Github pages exist before, this can be helpful in the future.</p>
