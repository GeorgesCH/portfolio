        </ul>
        <h3>Discussions/Formative activities:</h3>
        <h4>My initial post</h4>
        <p>When the EU introduced the&nbsp;GDPR regulation, I got many requests from various clients to comply with the new policies and update the terms of use of their websites. I was by then living outside the EU and didn't actually understand how crucial it is to comply with these standards.&nbsp;<br />
          <br />
          Understanding standardization and regulation is something on my top list to take out of this program. I also belive that many business around the glob reserve a big database of user data and it will be interesting to know how forgien websites and business implement these regulations for visitors from the EU. According to the&nbsp;GDPR compliance guide, the&nbsp;GDPR does apply outside Europe if the organisation uses web tools to track cookies or the IP addresses of people that visit the website from EU countries.&nbsp;<br />
          <br />
          After Brexit, the UK organisations that process personal data must now comply with the below according to&nbsp;itgovernance.co.uk</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The DPA (Data Protection Act) 2018 and UK GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) if they process only domestic personal data.</li>
          <li>The DPA 2018 and UK GDPR, and the EU GDPR if they process domestic personal data and offers goods and services to, or monitor the behaviour of, EU residents.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <p>I enjoyed working on the first week of the course, it has allowed me to understand the different roles of a computer practitioner and how it&rsquo;s employed in the current changing market, I have also learned the legal regulations and ethics for collecting and storing personal data such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the BCS Code of Conduct.</p>
        <p><strong>e-Portfolio set up</strong></p>
        <p>I have worked with GIT and other version control system before, as well as I&rsquo;m well experienced in HTML5, CSS, and Javascript, which made setting up the portfolio easy. However, I kind of missed a couple of the GIT commands as it&rsquo;s been a while I didn&rsquo;t use them, so it was nice to remember those.</p>
        <p>Also, I didn&rsquo;t know that Github pages exist before, this can be helpful in the future.</p>

        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <p>Now more than ever, computing continues to change our world, we now interact with others and complete everyday tasks, and impacting factors in our life. While computers are only a tool that interprets and visualise data using special programs for the different media types such as images, audio, video and web pages.</p>
        <p>These tools come in different shapes and sizes but they&rsquo;re mostly built with a&nbsp; combination of hardware and software allowing humans to use them, such as the below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Input unit</strong>: allows the computerised device to receive data, instructions or actions to solve any problem or make an action.</li>
          <li><strong>The central processing unit (CPU)</strong>: Once the data is received from the input device, they&rsquo;ll be processed in the CPU which is considered as the brain of the computer, which includes three major units (Control Unit, Arithmetic and Logic Unit, and Registers)</li>
          <li><strong>Memory unit</strong>: this unit is used to store the data before the actual processing starts, store the input data, intermedia results and final output generated.</li>
          <li><strong>Output unit</strong>: used to deliver the results to the user or other devices, obtained by the execution of a program.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Computers are machines that cant deal with different types of media and data, while in fact computers convert the media type into a numerical data system, a base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, that allows the computer to interpret and process the data, the data is represented in Bytes.</p>

        <h2><strong>Explore AI tools developed by Google</strong></h2>
        <p>I choose to explore Tensorflow, which is a software application popular for implementing machine learning algorithms particularly neural networks. What it does, is that i takes input as a multi-dimensional array where we can construct a sort of flowchart of operations that would like to perform on that input. It&rsquo;s used to process the input, through the system of operations and designed flow and comes out as output.</p>
        <h2><strong>Explore Google Translation</strong></h2>
        <p>Google translate has a vast database of the word, and phrases with their alternative in different languages that rely on user&rsquo;s feedback data when suggesting a translation. It also has a library of verified phrases and contributors. It relies on machine learning to compare the database records from user-inputted data, user feedback and labelled data for suggestion a translation and judging if the output is relevant. As well as showing other suggestions for alternative translation.</p>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>In this module, I have reviewed my knowledge in artificial intelligence (AI) on its capacity to parse and apply knowledge in different sectors and integrate different data sources to create valuable insights that can help in decision making or services output. I have also investigated the internet of things which brings together information from a series of connected devices that allows for the creation of analytics of systems, I also came across biometrics, blockchain, and robotics.</p>

        <p><strong>Introduction to HTML</strong></p>
        <p>The HTML excerises were a good exercise to see how the HTML and HTML5 have evaluated since the first time I learned HTML.</p>
        <p><strong>Emerging Technology</strong></p>
        <p>Virtual Machine: an instance of a physical computer with the only difference that virtual machines are computing within physical servers, existing only as code. Using virtual machines can be useful to set up a dedicated environment for a program, or a server. Also, during the research and development phase, where it allows us to create an unlimited number of computers with different operating systems using code only and sharing the resources of the same physical computer/server.</p>
        <p><strong>Bring Your Own Device (BYOD): </strong>This is a policy that&rsquo;s set by companies to allow employees to use their personal devices such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets for work. Which can help business reduce the fixed costs and maintenance for such while it can have some downside with security risks and privacy, as the device isn&rsquo;t managed by the company the employee is free to download and use other software and programs that might have access to certain corporate data. Also, other users might be allowed to use their personal computers and might have access to the company files and data.</p>
        <p><strong>Parallel computing: </strong>Parallel computing refers to the process of breaking down larger problems into smaller, independent, often similar parts that can be executed simultaneously by multiple processors communicating via shared memory, the results of which are combined upon completion as part of an overall algorithm. The primary goal of parallel computing is to increase available computation power for faster application processing and problem-solving.</p>
        <p><strong>Hadoop: </strong>a collection of tools that allows the storing of big data in a readily accessible and distributed environment. It enables processing the data parallelly, it&rsquo;s also an open-source framework that is quite popular in the big data industry.</p>
        <p><strong>Distributed computing: </strong>a field of computer science that studies distributed systems, that systems with components located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another to achieve a common goal.</p>
        <h2><strong>Reflections</strong></h2>
        <p>In this unit, I learned about networking and computer networks which how network infrastructure comprises hardware and software to enables computing and communication between users, services, application and processes using different communication networks security protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol TCP/IP, HTTP, Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the secure version of HTTP, FTP, Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocols. These protocols require management protocols to maintain and govern the network through protocols such as ICMP and SNMP.</p>

              <p><strong>Investigating Healthcare by Apple</strong><br>Apple is developing a platform to help users to keep track of their health, through the Watch and the health app. They’ve recently released a new feature allowing to measures a wearer’s blood oxygen levels and heart rhythms. It seems that Apple is moving toward healthcare, as they’ve increased their healthcare presence by expanding the product capabilities and partnering with leading health centres and research institutions.
                  One of the key successes to Apple, is the access they have to users, and their data that are currently being collecting using various methods, also Apple has gained the trust of the users to share, and store regularly personal and health data.
                  The health app uses automatic syncing of various data inputs to allow users to keep track of their sleep patterns, daily activities and much more. </p>

          <p>I enjoyed the readings where I learned about the history of operating systems, the components, and processes.
              I also found that python exercises were so insightful and interactive way to learn, I found it a bit challenging to learn the python syntax because it’s case sensitive and the indentation was very challenging for me. It was good to learn python and indentation using Codio because I think in modern IDE’s the editor would suggest the errors and correct formating.

              <p>Learning to write pseudocode was a bit challenging for me, although it doesn’t have a syntax I felt the need to refer to other Pseudocode examples and references. I kind of prefer using Flode chats as I can visualise the code and interactions where I can perhaps find other ways around the solution from the flow.<br>
                  Learning how to deal with lists, strings, user-defined functions, and recursion in python was like learning how to speak English in different accents. Although I’m still finding it a bit challenging to keep up with the python syntax where I sometimes forget to indent an if-statement or add the colons, I feel I’ll overcome this once I use python in a full project exercise.

          <p>I have enjoyed writing the module assignment, this has taught me a lot starting from how to use referencing manager tools, to how to find relevant and reliable information that can be used in reports or project pitches that I’m confronted with at work. However, doing this course and especially the written assignment has changed the way I plan and prepare a report.
              <br>
              This was the last unit, and overall I’m so grateful to have completed this course and I feel so lucky to have learned from Prof Nawaz Khan, where he shared lots of insights and tips on how to tackle the assignments as well it’s an application in business. I have initially signed up for the PG Cert only while now I’m considering completing the full MSc program.
